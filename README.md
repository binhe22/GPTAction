Welcome to the GPTs Action Collection repository! Our mission is to harness the dynamic capabilities of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) and enhance their interaction with the real world. We're building a future where GPTs can access and utilize real-time data, control smart devices, and even assist in everyday tasks. Join us in this exciting journey!



### Vision
Imagine a world where GPTs can:

* Keep up with real-time events and data, like stock market updates.
* Securely save and recall your chat history.
* Conveniently order food for you.
* Control home appliances, such as lights, to enhance your living experience.
* Provide secure access to your car by unlocking it on command.
To achieve this, we need robust and accessible actions. Our goal is to create a platform where these actions are readily available and easy to integrate with various GPT models.

### Roadmap
* OpenAI Action Schema Builder: A tool designed to help users effortlessly create action schemas for GPTs.
* Action Collection Initiative: We aim to compile a comprehensive list of GPT actions available across the internet. We welcome and encourage contributions via GitHub.
* Integration Platform: Developing a user-friendly product that allows seamless addition of actions to GPT models, including ChatGPT and other GPT variations.
